🔗 Reverse Stress Testing for Supply Chain Resilience

I'm excited to share a complete Python implementation of a groundbreaking methodology from a recent paper (arXiv:2511.07289) that's changing how we think about supply chain risk management.

🤔 The Problem with Traditional Stress Testing:

Most organizations ask: "What happens if X disrupts our supply chain?"

But this approach has a fatal flaw: you can only test scenarios you can imagine. What about the threats you haven't thought of?

💡 Enter Reverse Stress Testing:

Instead of starting with a threat scenario, RST works backwards:
• Start: "What if we lose 20% of copper wire imports?"
• Find: The most probable causes across the entire supply chain
• Result: Threat-agnostic vulnerability analysis with probabilities

🎯 Real-World Example (from the paper):

For US copper wire imports, RST reveals:
✓ Canada (refined copper) - consistent vulnerability across all scenarios
✓ Chile (unrefined copper) - critical at multiple tiers
✓ Peru (ore) - only matters for catastrophic disruptions
✓ Papua New Guinea (ore) - important for small disruptions only

These insights would be nearly impossible to discover through traditional scenario planning.

🛠️ What We Built:

A complete, production-ready implementation featuring:
• Multi-layer supply chain network modeling
• Bayesian probabilistic predictions
• Backpropagation algorithm for upstream analysis
• Publication-quality visualizations
• Real and synthetic data support
• ~2,000 lines of documented, tested code

📊 Key Innovations:

1. Threat-Agnostic: Discovers vulnerabilities without assuming specific scenarios
2. Probabilistic: Quantifies uncertainty in predictions
3. Comprehensive: Analyzes entire supply chain from raw materials to final product
4. Actionable: Provides clear vulnerability scores for risk prioritization

🎓 Why This Matters:

In an era of increasing supply chain complexity:
• COVID-19 pandemic disruptions
• Semiconductor shortages
• Geopolitical tensions
• Climate change impacts

We need tools that help us find vulnerabilities we haven't thought to look for.

💼 Applications:

✓ Critical infrastructure resilience
✓ National security (critical minerals, defense supply chains)
✓ Corporate supply chain planning
✓ Policy analysis and decision support
✓ Academic research on resilience

🔬 Methodology Highlights:

Based on financial sector reverse stress testing, adapted for physical supply chains:
• Uses covariance matrices of historical supplier relationships
• Implements principal component analysis for scenario generation
• Inverse Wishart sampling for uncertainty quantification
• Validated against real-world copper supply chain data

🚀 Ready to Use:

The full implementation includes:
• Core algorithm (780 lines)
• Data processing utilities (450 lines)
• Visualization tools (380 lines)
• Complete documentation
• Working demonstration
• Synthetic data generator

Perfect for risk managers, supply chain professionals, researchers, and anyone interested in resilience analysis.
